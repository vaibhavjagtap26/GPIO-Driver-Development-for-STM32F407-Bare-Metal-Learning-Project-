# GPIO-Driver-Development-for-STM32F407-Bare-Metal-Learning-Project-
“I developed a GPIO driver from scratch for STM32F407 by creating a device header, defining register structures, implementing clock control and GPIO APIs, and finally used the driver to control an LED and button at application level.”
In this project, I learned driver layer programming for the GPIO peripheral using the STM32F407 microcontroller.
Instead of using HAL libraries, I worked close to hardware to understand how peripherals actually work.
