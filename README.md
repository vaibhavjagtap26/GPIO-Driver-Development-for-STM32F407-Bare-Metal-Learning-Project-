# GPIO-Driver-Development-for-STM32F407-Bare-Metal-Learning-Project-
“I developed a GPIO driver from scratch for STM32F407 by creating a device header, defining register structures, implementing clock control and GPIO APIs, and finally used the driver to control an LED and button at application level.”
